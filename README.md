# odin-landing

## A landing page made based on the Odin assignment

Basic landing page, mostly as a final exam for the
first bunch of CSS lessons in Odin. Aside from the
more basic stuff, relies heavily on flexbox.

May or may not eventually convert to something actually
useful.

### Notes for improvement:

 - Check if Rubik font has regular font weight, it might not
 - Redo font coloring classes
    - Call to action uses low contrast bright font which looks a bit washed out
 - Make a copy of it and give it a unique spin
    - Add odin-portfolio functionality to it with images, links, etc.
